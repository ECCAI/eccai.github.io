    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
        In recent years, with the rapid development of AI, AI workloads are increasingly being generated and executed at the edge.
        However, due to the limited computational capabilities of edge devices, edge-cloud collaboration has gained growing attention from researchers.
        At the same time, new research directions have emerged around edge-cloud networking tailored for AI workloads and dynamically adjusting network bandwidth to support such collaboration. 
        Emerging AI technologies, such as edge-optimized deep learning and LLM-based network agents, further open up new possibilities for enhancing this paradigm.
    </p>
    <p>
        ECCAI 2025 invites original research that explores these questions, aiming to bridge researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of AI,
        mobile systems, edge computing, edge-cloud networking, and edge-cloud collaboration. We seek high-quality submissions describing novel ideas, system designs, 
        experimental studies, and real-world deployments in topics including, but not limited to:
    </p>
    <p>
    1. Supporting the Deployment and Execution of AI Applications in Edge-Cloud Collaboration
    <ul>
        <li>a. Processing video stream data within edge-cloud collaborative systems</li>
        <li>b. Optimizing support for real-time data processing at the edge, especially when data is generated at the edge and complex AI operations are performed in the cloud</li>
        <li>c. Integrating and optimizing AI data with various special patterns across edge and cloud environments</li>
        <li>d. Processing, acceleration, and accuracy enhancement of image, speech, and text data across edge and cloud</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    2. Leveraging AI technologies to enhance edge-cloud collaboration
    <ul>
        <li>a. Predicting workloads to determine whether tasks should be executed at the edge or in the cloud</li>
        <li>b. Using reinforcement learning to adjust network bandwidth usage and compute resource allocation</li>
        <li>c. Automatically compressing models to fit the constraints of edge devices</li>
        <li>d. Employing large language models (LLMs) or agent systems to optimize edge-cloud collaboration</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    3. Applications and specific challenges of AI in edge-cloud collaboration
    <ul>
        <li>a. Privacy protection issues in edge-cloud collaboration</li>
        <li>b. Applications of federated learning and knowledge distillation across edge and cloud environments</li>
        <li>c. The use of multimodal learning in edge-cloud collaborative systems</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    4.  Deployment Experiences and Case Studies
    <ul>
        <li>a. Large-scale deployments of AI workload on the edge devices and cloud</li>
        <li>b. Cloud-edge-device collaboration for real-time, AI-enhanced services</li>
